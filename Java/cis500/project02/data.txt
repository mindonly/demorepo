Julius Caesar is supposed to have used secret codes known today as Caesar cyphers. There are 26 such cyphers over the English alphabet. In the simplest, A is replaced with B, B is replaced with C, and so on, up to Z, which is replaced with A. This is called a rotate-one Caesar cypher because it rotates the alphabet one place. A rotate-two cypher replaces A with C, B with D, and so on up to Z which is replaced by B.
